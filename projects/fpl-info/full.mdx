# Description

Find out info about your team in <ExternalLink href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com">Fantasy Premier League</ExternalLink>

# Inspiration

The Premier League 20/21 season had just ended, and by extension the Fantasy Premier League 20/21 season as well. I knew that FPL provides an API to obtain some data about your team.

I wanted to use this opportunity to learn how to set up <ExternalLink href="https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction">Serverless Functions with Vercel</ExternalLink>, and also to learn more about organizing data, as FPL provides quite a lot of data, especially mid-season.
