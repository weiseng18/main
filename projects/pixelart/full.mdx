# Description

Create and animate pixel art in the browser

# Inspiration

While working on the maze project, I had to use a stickman sprite to represent the player in the maze. I created my own sprite using <ExternalLink href="https://www.pixilart.com/">pixilart.com</ExternalLink>. I felt that since a pixelart canvas is essentially a 2D array of colors, creating a similar web app should be approachable, and thus interesting to replicate.
