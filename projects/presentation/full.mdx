# Description

Slides for my end of internship presentation at <ExternalLink href="https://open.gov.sg">Open Government Products</ExternalLink>.

# Inspiration

The idea of building slides as a web page came from 2015, during the Projects Day presentations. The original reason was that HTML slides would be much more lightweight compared to `.pptx` files.

I previously got that to work, but it was quite tedious to edit content, because I would need to manually build the HTML structure of the page, and also apply styles manually.

After my first software engineering internship, I learnt about and used web frameworks for the first time in my life. I felt that I could give this idea another shot, especially with the knowledge of React components, and Chakra UI. I also noticed that Chakra UI has a dependency `framer-motion`, a library that helps in web animation, so I took this opportunity to use it in this project.

Writing content is still slightly troublesome, but it was much better than the static HTML page version I created in 2015. I realized that I could test out this project by using it to write slides for my end of internship presentation, and it turned out quite decent.
