# Description

Gets 2-hour weather forecast from <ExternalLink href="https://data.gov.sg">data.gov.sg</ExternalLink>, and pings everyone if the forecast is rain.

# Inspiration

Laundry is hanged outdoors to dry after being washed. It is not always possible to realize that rain has begun to fall, so there have been occasions when laundry became wet due to the rain, which defeats the purpose of hanging laundry outdoors.

This bot sends a notification to my family when the 2-hour weather forecast states a form of rain. This ensures that we are aware that rain might be imminent, so that we can prepare to keep the laundry indoors.
