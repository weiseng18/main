# Description

Uses Prim's algorithm to generate a maze, and DFS to solve the maze.

It is technically playable, but just a MVP.

# Inspiration

This was my first project hosted on Github. At that point, my goal was to learn how to use `git` and familiarize myself with Github Pages. As such I wanted to work on something that I'm familiar with.

I was in the process of re-organizing my competitive programming knowledge. While working on Prim's algorithm, I realized that it could be used for maze generation, so I decided to implement it in the browser.
